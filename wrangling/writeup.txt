* My approach to solving these problems was to begin by understanding the data given. Next, I looked at the main functions to see how the supporting functions were called. Finally, I implemented the functions one by one until all tests were passed.
* For external resources, I used the Piazza forum and the Python documentation.
* In the election results, I was surprised by how many districts had margins of less than 10 percent. In the word counts results, most of the most popular words showed up as frequent as they do in the English Language, with the exception of those that are classic political words. Some of these classic political words include security, economic, great, united, freedom, etc. One thing I found surprising was how often "will" was used. It's pretty common in the English language but it isn't ranked quite as high as it is in our data. This leads me to believe that it's used so often in politics because politicians want to convey that they will create change and that they will get things done.
